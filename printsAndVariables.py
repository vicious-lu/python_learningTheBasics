#As simple as that:
print("Hola mundo")

#With variables
word = "Hola mundo"
print(word)
word = 2      #The value can be changed during execution, and dont need to add a typo
print(word)

#Simple variable use
x = 10
y = 5
z = x + y
print(z)
print(x)
print(y)

#how to get the memory location of a variable
g = 2
print(id(g)) #this way it prints the memory location instead of the varibale stored itself
print(id(y))
print(id(x))
print(id(z))
